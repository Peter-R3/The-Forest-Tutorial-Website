                <p class="content-paragraph2">Fighting things in The Forest, melee wise, is pretty easy. There's 'block' and 'attack', it is a very simple fighting system. To get good at it, you want to focus on both blocking and your movement. If you block, you can take a hit or two and wait for the opening to then attack. If you have attacked too early and are unable to block, focus your movement, and get out of the way. With a bit of practise, you can get the hang of it really quickly.</p>

            <div>
                <header class="content-header">Ranged Fighting</header>
                <p class="content-paragraph2">Using ranged weaponry in The Forest is also just as easy! As long as you play smart. It's very easy for people to rush into combat with a bow and arrow in hand, but this is not the best approach. If you get caught up with a bow and arrow in your hands and suddenly you're greeted by cannibals, you want to focus your movement and timing. You want to move backwards to maintain distance and time your shots, be patient and swift. Contradicting, but it's possible if you find the right balance between having patience and reacting quickly. Alternatively, if you are not surprised by them and instead they come to attack your beautiful tree house, then use the height to your advantage! They aren't the smartest of creatures and will not use ranged attacks or come up your tree house to greet you.</p>
