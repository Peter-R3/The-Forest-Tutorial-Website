                        <td class="table-right">This method is done by killing the wildlife, you must kill an animal then you may skin the animal to remove the skin. From there, you'll be able to collect the animals meat.</td>

From there, you'll need to chop the body up into pieces. Once done, you'll be able to collect the various body parts to obtain the edible pieces.</td>

                <p class="content-paragraph2">Cooking food first requires you to build a campfire. To cook an item, you will have to look at a lit campfire and it will provide the option to add the food you are holding in your inventory. Alternatively, there is the abilty to equip specific food and then place it on the campfire by looking at it. For the recipe of the campfire, see the survival guide. For guidance on how to get the resources, see the resources page. For guidance on how to build, select the 'building' element under 'building elements' to the left of your screen.
