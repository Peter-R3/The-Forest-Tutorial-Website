You can also get polluted water if you own a waterskin or an old pot. Finally, there is the ability to build a water collector. Water collectors will fill up naturally with clean water when it rains. For the recipe of the water collector, see the survival guide. For guidance on how to get the resources, see the resources page. For guidance on how to build, select the 'building' element under 'building elements' to the left of your screen. You may also use the quick navigation options below.</td>

To drink from a waterskin, you may do the same and access it from your inventory. To drink from an old pot, you can fill it up or boil it on a campfire, then you make drink it in the same way, except when you boil it, you will be able to drink it straight from the campfire by looking at it. Finally, you may drink from a water collector by looking at it when there is water in it. For the recipe of the water collector or campfire, see the survival guide.
